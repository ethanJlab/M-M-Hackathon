Dear Donhav Noname,

As discussed, your attorney feel it would be best to move forward with litigation in your case. In an effort to proceed as quickly and efficiently as possible we are sending you the enclosed questions to be answered. Your answers to these interrogatories are a very important part of this litigation and it is necessary that you devote time and attention to fully and truthfully answering these questions.  We prefer that you answer in too much detail rather than in too little detail.  If you don’t know an answer, please contact  by direct dial at  or by email at .

Please review each question thoroughly so that you can prepare the answers in as great a detail as possible.  Some of the questions have several parts and the law requires that you answer each one fully and completely.  It would be very helpful if you write your answers to the questions on separate sheets of paper, numbering each of your answers.  In the alternative, you can send me an email to pblair@forthepeople.com with your answers to each of the questions.  

We ask that these be completed as soon as possible. When the at-fault party has hired an attorney to defend them in this lawsuit they may have additional questions and we will reach out to you at that time. If there are no additional questions, we will then type your answers into the appropriate legal form at that time and return them to you in final form to be signed in front of a Notary Public.  
Please answer these questions and return the answers and the requested documents to us by .  

If you have any questions, please feel free to call me or .  will be assisting Attorney Stefanie Young as the lawsuit progresses.  can be reach by direct dial at  or my email at pblair@forthepeople.com.

Sincerely,
