Dear Ms. Beach:

As you are aware, our firm has been retained to represent Donhav Noname in his negligence claim against your insured.  After careful consideration, it is our belief that this claim has reached a point where settlement can and should be considered, thereby avoiding the undue costs associated with litigation. This claim can and should resolve at this time.

It is our position that liability is clear and that the only issue to be negotiated in this case is the value of the bodily injury claim.  

NATURE OF INJURY:








ECONOMIC DAMAGES:


LIFE EXPECTANCY:	 47.83 years

FUTURE MEDICAL TREATMENT:

Given the nature of his injuries and the amount of pain that he continues to suffer, it is medically certain that Donhav Noname will require additional medical treatment in the future to mitigate his injuries.  Coastal Healthcare Partners  opined within a reasonable degree of medical probability and/or certainty that Donhav Noname’s injuries are directly related to the crash of April 25, 2021.  at  opined within reasonable degree of medical probability and/or certainty that Donhav Noname will require future medical treatment to mitigate the injuries that Donhav Noname sustained in this crash. The estimated cost of Donhav Noname’s future medical treatment is approximately $55,000.000.00. See enclosed surgical estimates/final narrative/medical cost projection authorized by Coastal Healthcare Partners  for your review.

NON-ECONOMIC DAMAGES:	

Donhav Noname’s life was abruptly interrupted by the negligence of your insured when he had to seek medical treatment to mitigate the injuries he sustained in this crash.  Donhav Noname has had to undergo Hospital, Injection, Chiropractic, Diagnostic Imaging - MRI, Orthopaedic and Other. Donhav Noname has consistently suffered and experienced pain caused by the injuries he sustained in the crash.  Coastal Healthcare Partners  at  opined within a reasonable degree of medical probability and/or certainty that Donhav Noname sustained permanent injuries as a direct result of this crash. Therefore, Donhav Noname is pursuing both economic and non-economic damages.

In the event this claim does not resolve in accordance with the terms and conditions of this demand, Plaintiff will present a customary per diem argument to the jury for non-economic damages. 

A fair and reasonable amount to compensate Donhav Noname for his pain, suffering, mental anguish, and inconvenience since April 25, 2021 is $20.00 per hour for every waking hour he has spent suffering with pain caused by the injuries he sustained in this crash. (Generally 16 waking hours per day).

PAST PAIN & SUFFERING: 718 days since crash x $20.00/hour x 18 hours per day =  $258,480.00

A fair and reasonable amount to compensate Donhav Noname for his future pain and suffering is $20.00 per waking hours for the remainder of his life. 

FUTURE PAIN & SUFFERING: Life Expectancy is 47.83 years x 365 days/year x 18 hours/day x $20.00/hr = $6,284,862.00
