Dear Sir/Madam:

Enclosed herewith please find a copy of our demand portfolio recently submitted to the Defendantâ€™s Carrier.  As you can see, we have demanded that the tender its policy limits.  

This will serve as our formal notice to you of our intent to pursue an underinsured motorist claim under our client's policy.  Our demand is for your full policy limits.  

A lawsuit has been filed on this claim.  Service of process is being held for 5 days.  This a one-time offer to settle prior to service.  

We look forward to hearing from you, and hopefully, bringing this matter to an amicable resolution

Very truly yours, 

/s
Stefanie Young
