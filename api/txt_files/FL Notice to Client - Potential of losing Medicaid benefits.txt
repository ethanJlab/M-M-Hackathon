Re:	Preston Blair - test matter DO NOT EDIT
	
Dear Mr. East:

As we discussed we have settled your bodily injury case with the tortfeasor for $5,000.00.  You clearly will have proceeds that exceed $2,000.00.
 
You must notify Medicaid/Staywell/SSI of the settlement received in relation to the automobile accident on November 1, 2021.  You have ten (10) days from the receipt of the proceeds check to notify Medicaid/Staywell/SSI of this settlement.  
 
Please be aware that since the settlement proceeds may qualify your assets over $2,000.00 you and/or your family members may no longer be eligible to receive Medicaid/Staywell/SSI benefits and/or the settlement may affect your rights to Medicaid/Staywell/SSI benefits at the present and in the future for you and your family. We strongly suggest you contact a specialist who can assist you in this matter in order to protect the money you are receiving and enable you to continue receiving Medicaid/Staywell/SSI benefits.  

If you do not know who to talk to on this matter, you may want to contact to see what you need to do to protect your benefits.: 

                                  The Florida Pooled Trust  1-800-989-2773. 
â€ƒ
Please sign below to indicate that you have read and understand all listed above and continue to choose to have the proceeds issued directly to you.

I, Andrew East, have been informed by Morgan & Morgan Atlanta PLLC that it is my responsibility and not the responsibility of Morgan & Morgan Atlanta PLLC to notify Medicaid/Staywell/SSI of the settlement that I will receive in relation to the automobile accident on November 1, 2021.  I understand that I have ten (10) days from the receipt of the proceeds check to notify Medicaid/Staywell/SSI of this settlement.  
 
I am aware that since I may receive proceeds from this settlement, my family and I may no longer be eligible to receive Medicaid/Staywell/SSI benefits and/or the settlement may affect our rights to Medicaid/Staywell/SSI benefits at the present and in the future.  We have been advised to contact a specialist in the area in order to protect the rights of our family but after all the consideration we have chosen to have the settlement proceeds issued directly to us and not placed into a Special Needs Trust Fund.
