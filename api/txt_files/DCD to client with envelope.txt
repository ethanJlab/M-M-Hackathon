Re: Accident of 11/11/21

Dear Mr. East:

Enclosed please find our check in the amount of $286.50, which represents the delayed cost deposit withheld from your settlement proceeds.

As you know, we originally withheld $300.00 as a delayed cost deposit.  The additional costs were copies, postage, telephone calls, etc.  The enclosed check reflects the balance remaining after the costs were deducted from the original amount.

Once again, thank you for the opportunity to represent you in this matter. Please feel free to contact me in the future, if I can be of any further assistance to you.

Sincerely,




Brandon Doll
