INITIATION OF TREATMENT

To Whom It May Concern:

This is to inform you that I was injured in a motor vehicle accident. This letter is to confirm that I intend to initiate

treatment therapy as outlined by the doctors at Integrity Medical Group, LLC

CONSENT FOR TREATMENT

I hereby authorize your practice and whomever the doctor may designate as assistant to perform examination,
physiotherapy, physical therapy and perform non-invasive diagnostic tests and, if any unforeseen condition arises in the
course of the procedures calling for judgment, procedures in addition to or different from those contemplated. I further
request and authorize this office to perform whatever my treating doctor deems advisable. The nature and purpose of
these procedures have risks involved and the possibility of complications has been fully explained to me. I acknowledge

that no guarantee has been made to me as to the result that may be obtained. I have the right to refuse additional
treatment aside from a consultation.
