Notes: Patient presents today for a new patient evaluation. She complains of neck and lower back pains that have been present since
her accident. She denies any radicular symptoms into the upper or lower extremities. She has been attending a therapy program and
using over-the-counter ibuprofen which does provide some short-term relief of her symptoms. We reviewed her cervical and lumbar
spine MRI studies in the office today and discussed a course of spinal injections. She is managing her symptoms well at this time and
wishes to continue with conservative means of treatment. I will prescribe Robaxin and ibuprofen to use as needed for muscle spasms
and inflammation. I encouraged her to continue her therapy program, light stretching/exercise and activities as tolerated. I will see
her back in 4-6 weeks. She understands and agrees with the plan.*** Today's visit included the CPT code 99204. 45-59 minutes was
used preparing to see the patient (e.g, review of tests); obtaining and/or reviewing separately obtained history; ordering
medications, tests or procedures; documenting clinical information in the electronic health record (EHR) or other records; and
communicating with the patient, family, and/or caregiver.

Follow Up
* RTC in 4-6 weeks, I have asked the patient to call the office in the interim if they have any problems or changes in their symptoms
