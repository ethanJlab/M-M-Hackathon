Dear  :

We have relayed your settlement offer in the amount of $25,000.00 to our client, Andrew East, and this will serve as their rejection of same.  

As our offer to settle for policy limits was not accepted, we hereby withdraw that offer to settle and now demand $10,000.00. Please notify your insured as this demand is in excess of the policy limits and may potentially amount to personal exposure to your insured. By doing so, we can spare all parties additional legal fees, costs, and delay.  

This offer of settlement will remain open for ten (10) days from the date of receipt of this letter. Should this offer of settlement not be accepted, we will proceed with filing the attached complaint on .

Please contact my Case Manager, Preston Blair at (901) 333-1823 or pblair@forthepeople.com, in order to discuss settlement at your earliest convenience.

Thank you for your assistance in this matter.

Sincerely, 



Brandon Doll
