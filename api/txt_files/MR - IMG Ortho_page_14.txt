Patient Acknowledgement and Waiver

To the extent that, I » have health insurance benefits for
which my medical ider agreement(“Provider Agreement”) in
effect with such health insurance provider, I acknowledge that:

Despite any requirements in the “Provider Agreement” for provider to submit claims for
services and treatments (collectively Services) to my health insurance plan within a particular
timeframe, and despite any statement in the provider agreement notifying the medical services
provider that failure to submit claims for services within a specific timeframe will preclude
payment to the provider and prohibit the medical services provider from charging me(or
anyone else related to me) for said services, medical service provider will not be submitting
claims to my health insurance plan for any services he/she has rendered to me: and

I have certain third-
reling i

party beneficiary rights under the provider agreement and I hereby
7 wledgeably, and intentionally.

.

I, further acknowledge that:

I will be responsible for the payment for all services rendered to me by the medical services
provider;

In lieu of the medical services provider billing me or my health insurance plan for my services,
health insurance provider, health insurance provider will enter into a medical lien with myself
whereby medical services provider wil! be compensated for all services he/she provides to me,

as a direct or indirect result of my personal injury case, from the proceeds of my settlement of
Said personal injury case; and

The compensation that medical services provider will receive under the medical lien will likely
exceed the compensation that medical services provider would have received if the medical
services provider would have submitted claims to my health insurance plan for my services,
and I believe that such additional compensation is equitable in light of the nature of the services
that medical services provider will be furnishing to me.
