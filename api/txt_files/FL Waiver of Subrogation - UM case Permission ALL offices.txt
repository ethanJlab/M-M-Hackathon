Dear Ms. Beach:

Be advised that the tortfeasor has tendered its limits in the above referenced case.  Pursuant to § 627.727(6)(a), Fla. Stat., we hereby request that you waive subrogation.  

Furthermore, in consideration of our client’s election to forgo seeking an excess judgment by settling with the tortfeasor, you hereby agree to contractually waive removal of any potential UM action to Federal Court.  

Sincerely,


Stefanie Young Esq.
