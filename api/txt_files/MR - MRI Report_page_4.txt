EXAMINATION: MRI LUMBAR SPINE WITHOUT CONTRAST

Biforaminal disc

As a board-certified physician licensed to practice medicine in the State of Florida and after having reviewed
the clinical information provided on the patient's clinical intake form as well as the MRI imaging performed, it

is my opinion that the findings are positive for an emergency ical condition as defined by the Florida's
Motor Vehicle No-Fault statute. The basis of the finding of a is that the patient has sustained acute

symptoms of sufficient severity, which may include severe pain such as the absence of immediate medical
attention could reasonably be expected to result in serious jeopardy to this patient's health and/or serious
impairment to bodily functions and/or serious dysfunction of any bodily organ or part.

Thank you for referring your patient,

Richard A. Sarner, MD
