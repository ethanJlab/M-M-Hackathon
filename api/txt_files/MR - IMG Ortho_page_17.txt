INTEGRITY MEDICAL GROUP, LLC

SURGERY CANCELLATION POLICY

Integrity Medical Group requires at least 48 business hours cancellation notice for
surgical procedures. Please be aware that time is immediately blocked upon scheduling
your procedure. If adequate notice is not given, we are unable to utilize this time for
another patient.

If you fail to notify our office of your cancellation at least 48 business hours prior to
the procedure you will be charged a $5000 cancellation fee. This fee will not be paid
by your insurance company. This will be a fee that you must pay personally or through
your medical Lien if one is on file.

We do understand that there may be extenuating circumstances such as cancellations
secondary to medical problems or abnormal labs. In these cases a fee will not be
charged to your count.

By signing below you indicate that you understand the above policy and agree to said
charges if adequate notice is not given.
